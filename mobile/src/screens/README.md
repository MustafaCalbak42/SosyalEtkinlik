# Email Verification Implementation for Mobile App

## Overview
This document explains the email verification flow implemented in the mobile application, matching the functionality that already exists in the web application.

## Flow
1. **Registration**: 
   - User registers in the app, providing email and other details
   - System creates a new unverified user account
   - A verification email is sent with a link containing a token

2. **Verification Process**:
   - When the user clicks the link in email, the backend (verifyEmail endpoint) verifies the token
   - Depending on the platform (detected via User-Agent), the user is redirected to either:
     - Web app: to the /email-verified route
     - Mobile app: to the deep link exp://sosyaletkinlik/email-verified with appropriate parameters

3. **Mobile Deep Link Handling**:
   - AppNavigator.js handles the incoming deep link
   - Parameters (success, token, refreshToken, error, email) are parsed
   - User is directed to the EmailVerifiedScreen

4. **EmailVerifiedScreen**:
   - Processes the verification parameters using the processVerificationDeepLink helper
   - On success: displays confirmation and allows user to navigate to the main app
   - On failure: shows error details and offers options to resend verification or go to login

5. **Login Screen Handling**:
   - Shows special errors for unverified emails
   - Provides a "Resend Verification Email" button for users with unverified accounts

## Testing Verification Flow
1. Register a new account
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click link or copy to browser
4. Observe redirection to mobile app and verification result
5. Test alternative scenarios:
   - Expired token
   - Invalid token
   - Already verified account

## Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS for links
- Set appropriate token expiration (5 minutes)
- Provide clear error messages
- Allow resending verification emails
- Log appropriate information for troubleshooting
